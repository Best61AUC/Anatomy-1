        <h1>Radiological Anatomy: Fundamentals</h1>
        
        <h2>Bone Structure & Classification</h2>
        
        <h3>Parts of a Long Bone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">Epiphysis:</span> The expanded end of a long bone, which forms a joint with another bone. It is covered by a layer of <span class="highlight">articular cartilage</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Diaphysis:</span> The main shaft of the bone, located between the two epiphyses.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Metaphysis:</span> The region between the epiphysis and diaphysis. In growing bones, it contains the <span class="highlight">epiphyseal disk</span> (growth plate), a band of cartilage responsible for bone lengthening.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Anatomy 1.png" alt="Diagram showing the parts of a long bone: Epiphysis, Diaphysis, and Metaphysis." class="anatomy-image">

        <h3>Bone Histology (Tissue Types)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">Compact Bone (Cortex):</span> A dense, tightly packed tissue that forms the hard outer wall of the diaphysis, creating a rigid tube. It contains no visible spaces.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Spongy Bone (Medulla):</span> Located inside the compact bone, forming a hollow chamber. It consists of a network of branching bony plates called <strong>trabeculae</strong>. The spaces between trabeculae are filled with <strong>bone marrow</strong>, which produces blood cells.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="page-container">
        <div class="logo">Dr. Abdelrahman</div>
        <h2>Bone Classification by Shape</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">Long Bones:</span> Have a longitudinal axis and expanded ends (e.g., bones of the arms and legs like the femur and humerus).</li>
            <li><span class="term">Short Bones:</span> Roughly cube-shaped (e.g., bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals)).</li>
            <li><span class="term">Flat Bones:</span> Plate-like structures with broad surfaces (e.g., scapula, ribs, most skull bones).</li>
            <li><span class="term">Irregular Bones:</span> Have complex, varied shapes that do not fit into other categories (e.g., vertebrae, some facial bones).</li>
            <li><span class="term">Sesamoid Bones:</span> Small bones that develop within tendons, typically near joints, to reduce friction and modify pressure (e.g., the <strong>patella</strong> or kneecap).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bone Membranes and Growth</h2>
        <h3>Membranes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">Periosteum:</span> A tough, fibrous tissue layer that covers the entire surface of a bone, except for the articular cartilage on the epiphyses. It is rich in nerves and provides attachment points for tendons and ligaments.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Endosteum:</span> A thin membrane that lines the medullary cavity (the hollow part of the diaphysis).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bone Growth (Ossification)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most skeletal bones are <span class="highlight">endochondral bones</span>, meaning they develop from a cartilage model.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Ossification Center:</strong> The process begins in the center of the diaphysis, where cartilage is replaced by bone tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Ossification Centers:</strong> Appear later in the epiphyses, with bone formation spreading outwards.</li>
            <li>The <span class="term">epiphyseal disk</span> (metaphysis) remains as cartilage, allowing the bone to grow in length as long as its cells are active. Once growth is complete, it ossifies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Joints (Articulations)</h1>
        <p>A joint is formed where two or more bones meet. They are classified by their structure.</p>
        
        <h2>A) Synovial Joints</h2>
        <p>The most common type of joint, allowing for significant movement. They have a characteristic structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="term">Articular Cartilage:</span> A thin layer of hyaline cartilage covering the ends of the bones within the joint to reduce friction.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Joint Capsule:</span> A two-layered structure that encloses the joint.
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li><strong>Outer fibrous layer:</strong> Attaches to the periosteum of the bones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner synovial membrane:</strong> Lines the joint cavity but does not cover the articular cartilage. It secretes synovial fluid.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="term">Synovial Cavity:</span> A closed sac formed by the synovial membrane, containing synovial fluid.</li>
            <li><span class="term">Synovial Fluid:</span> A clear, viscous fluid that lubricates and moistens the cartilaginous surfaces, reducing friction and absorbing shock.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>B) Fibrous Joints</h2>
        <p>Bones are in close contact and held together by dense fibrous connective tissue. These joints allow for <strong>no or very limited movement</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> The sutures of the skull.</li>
            <li>In infants, these areas are membranous regions called <span class="highlight">fontanels</span>. Fontanels allow the skull to change shape during birth and accommodate brain growth. They later ossify and are replaced by sutures in adults.</li>

        <h2>C) Cartilaginous Joints</h2>
        <p>Bones are connected by hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage. These joints allow for slight movement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> The joint between the sternum and the first rib (connected by costal cartilage).</li>
            <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Joints between vertebral bodies, which are separated by cartilaginous <span class="highlight">intervertebral disks</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> The <span class="term">symphysis pubis</span>, which is the junction between the two hip bones in the pelvis.</li>

        <h1>The Vertebral Column (Spine)</h1>
        <p>The vertebral column is the central axis of the skeleton, providing support, flexibility, and protection for the spinal cord.</p>
        
        <h2>Structure of a Typical Vertebra</h2>
        <p>A typical vertebra consists of two main parts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Vertebral Body:</strong> The thick, anterior, weight-bearing part. The bodies increase in size from the cervical to the lumbar region to support increasing weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Vertebral Arch:</strong> The posterior part that encloses the <span class="highlight">vertebral foramen</span> (the space for the spinal cord). It is formed by:
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Two <strong>Pedicles:</strong> Short bars that project from the body.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Vertebral Processes (7 total)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spinous Process (1):</strong> Projects posteriorly from the junction of the laminae.</li>
            <li><strong>Transverse Processes (2):</strong> Project laterally from the junction of the pedicles and laminae.</li>
            <li><strong>Articular Processes (4):</strong> Two superior and two inferior processes, which form synovial joints with the adjacent vertebrae.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Joints of the Vertebral Column</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Between Vertebral Bodies:</strong> Cartilaginous joints connected by <span class="term">intervertebral discs</span> (composed of an inner nucleus pulposus and outer annulus fibrosus).</li>

        <h1>The Skull</h1>
        <p>The skull is the most complex bony structure in the body. It encloses the brain, houses the organs of special senses, and surrounds the openings of the digestive and respiratory tracts.</p>
        <p>The bones are subdivided into the <strong>Calvaria (Cranium)</strong> and the <strong>Facial Skeleton</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>I. The Calvaria (Cranium)</h2>
        <p>A box-like structure composed of 8 bones that protect the brain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unpaired Bones:</strong> Frontal, Occipital, Sphenoid, Ethmoid.</li>
            <li><strong>Paired Bones:</strong> Parietal (2), Temporal (2).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1. Frontal Bone</h3>
        <p>Forms the forehead and the roof of the orbits (eye sockets).</p>
        
        <h3>2. Parietal Bones (Paired)</h3>
        <p>Form the majority of the superior and lateral walls of the calvaria. They articulate with each other at the <span class="highlight">sagittal suture</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Occipital Bone</h3>
        <p>Forms most of the posterior and base of the skull. It contains the <span class="highlight">foramen magnum</span>, the large opening through which the spinal cord connects to the brainstem. It also has <span class="term">occipital condyles</span> for articulation with the C1 vertebra (atlas).</p>

        <h2>The Calvaria (Cranium) (Continued)</h2>
        
        <h3>4. Temporal Bones (Paired)</h3>
        <p>Form parts of the sides and base of the skull. Each temporal bone has several important parts and processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Squamous Part:</strong> The flat, fan-like superior part.</li>
            <li><strong>Zygomatic Process:</strong> Projects anteriorly to articulate with the zygomatic bone, forming the <span class="highlight">zygomatic arch</span> (cheekbone).</li>
            <li><strong>Petrous Part:</strong> A dense, pyramid-shaped part that houses the internal and middle ear organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Mastoid Process:</strong> A prominent bump posterior to the ear, for muscle attachment.</li>
            <li><strong>Styloid Process:</strong> A thin, pointed projection inferiorly.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandibular Fossa:</strong> Articulates with the mandible to form the <span class="highlight">temporomandibular joint (TMJ)</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Sphenoid Bone</h3>
        <p>A complex, bat-shaped bone that forms the anterior base of the skull. It is considered the "keystone" of the cranium because it articulates with all other cranial bones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Key feature: The <span class="term">sella turcica</span>, a depression on its superior surface that houses the <strong>pituitary gland</strong>.</li>

        <p>The facial skeleton is formed by 14 bones (most are paired).</p>
        
        <h3>1. Mandible (Unpaired)</h3>
        <p>The U-shaped bone of the lower jaw. It is the <strong>largest and strongest facial bone</strong> and the only freely movable bone of the skull (excluding the ossicles of the ear).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Body:</strong> The horizontal part that contains the sockets for the lower teeth.</li>
            <li><strong>Rami (2):</strong> The two vertical parts that ascend from the body. Each ramus has:
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>A posterior <span class="term">Condylar Process</span> (which articulates with the temporal bone at the TMJ).</li>
                    <li>An anterior <span class="term">Coronoid Process</span> (for muscle attachment).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The point where the body and ramus meet is the <span class="term">mandibular angle</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Anatomy 26.png" alt="Anatomy of the Mandible." class="anatomy-image">
        
        <h3>2. Maxillae (Paired)</h3>
        <p>The two maxillae fuse medially to form the upper jaw and the central portion of the facial skeleton. They are the "keystone" bones of the face, articulating with all other facial bones except the mandible.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Zygomatic Bones (Paired)</h3>
        <p>The cheekbones. They form the prominences of the cheeks and the inferolateral margins of the orbits.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Nasal Bones (Paired)</h3>
        <p>Form the bridge of the nose.</p>

        <h3>5. Other Facial Bones</h3>
        <p>Lacrimal bones, palatine bones, vomer, and inferior nasal conchae complete the facial skeleton.</p>

            <li>Urine is moved by muscular peristaltic waves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Urinary Bladder (UB)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A hollow, muscular, distensible organ located in the pelvis, just posterior to the symphysis pubis.</li>
            <li>Serves as a temporary storage reservoir for urine.</li>
            <li>In males, it lies anterior to the rectum. In females, it lies anterior to the uterus.</li>

        <h3>The Urethra</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A muscular tube that conveys urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Female Urethra:</strong> Short (about 4 cm) and serves only a urinary function.</li>
            <li><strong>Male Urethra:</strong> Long (about 18 cm) and serves both urinary and reproductive functions (transports urine and semen). It is divided into three regions:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prostatic Urethra:</strong> Passes through the prostate gland.</li>

        <h1>The Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract</h1>
        <p>The digestive system is composed of the alimentary canal and accessory organs. Its function is to digest food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste.</p>
        
        <h3>1. The Alimentary Canal (GI Tract)</h3>
        <p>A continuous muscular tube, about 9 meters long, extending from the mouth to the anus. It includes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Accessory Organs</h3>
        <p>These organs release secretions into the alimentary canal to aid digestion. They include the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.</p>
        
        <h2>The Pharynx (Throat)</h2>
        <p>A cavity posterior to the mouth that connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx and esophagus. It serves as a passageway for both food and air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nasopharynx:</strong> Superior part, posterior to the nasal cavity. Passageway for air only.</li>
            <li><strong>Oropharynx:</strong> Middle part, posterior to the oral cavity. Passageway for both food and air.</li>
            <li><strong>Laryngopharynx:</strong> Inferior part, continuous with the esophagus. Passageway for both food and air.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Esophagus</h2>
        <p>A muscular tube about 25 cm long that provides a passageway for food and fluids from the pharynx to the stomach. It lies posterior to the trachea and travels through the mediastinum, piercing the diaphragm to enter the stomach.</p>
